# FUTURE_OF_EDUCATION-WEBSITE
## Aim:
To design and develop an innovative online learning platform that provides personalized learning paths, interactive courses, and community forums for students of all ages. The platform focuses on accessibility and engagement, using modern web technologies.

## Apparatus Required:
VS code

## Theory:
The Future of Education platform is a web-based learning system designed to provide students of all ages with access to a wide range of educational resources. The core focus is on delivering an engaging, personalized, and accessible learning experience, enabling students to follow their own educational paths. Here's a detailed breakdown of the theory behind the design and implementation:

## Front-End Design :
The front-end design of the platform plays a critical role in ensuring that users interact with the platform effectively.
HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) forms the foundation, structuring the layout of the website. This includes defining headers, paragraphs, images, forms, and buttons.
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) enhances the visual appearance, providing a clean and aesthetically pleasing interface. It helps to control the layout of multiple web pages, ensuring consistency in design.
JavaScript adds interactivity, making the website more dynamic and responsive to user actions. For example, JavaScript enables functionality like form validation, user notifications (e.g., successful registration), and responsive buttons.
